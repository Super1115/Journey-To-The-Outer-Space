        "Uranus Formation",
        "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is considered an ice giant because it is largely made up of water, ammonia, and methane in solid form. Like all the other planets, Uranus was likely formed in a massive, ancient cloud of gas, dust, and ice that collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc. Scientists believe the differences between ice giants and gas giants (like Saturn and Jupiter) are due to their slightly different formation histories."

        "Uranus Rotation, orbit, and tilt",
        "A day on Uranus lasts about 17 hours. Interestingly, different parts of Uranus rotate at different speeds: while the interior of the planet spins in that time, its upper atmosphere completes a full rotation three hours faster, which creates some of the most violent winds in the solar system. Near Uranus's poles, they blow in the same direction as the rotation of the planet. Closer to the equator, the winds blow in the opposite direction!\n\nUranus takes 84 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun.\n\nInstead of rotating vertically like all of the other planets, Uranus spins around a horizontal axis. Scientists believe that an Earth-sized planet may have collided with Uranus and knocked it on its side.\n\nUranus's dramatic 98-degree tilt gives rise to the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly 21 years, a quarter of the Uranian year, one pole is bathed in sunlight while the other exists in complete darkness. For the next 21 years, both poles receive similar amounts of sunlight as they gradually switch places and the cycle repeats."

        "Like the other giant planets in our solar system, Uranus does not have a solid surface. Scientists believe that the interior is made up of a solid rocky core covered by a dense liquid layer of water and ammonia. The atmosphere surrounding the interior of the planet is mostly hydrogen and helium. Despite having the second fastest winds in the solar system (after Neptune), Uranus's atmosphere looks quite calm. Very few clouds are observed in its light blue atmosphere."

        "Uranus Rings",
        "Although Saturn is best known for its elaborate ring system, all of the giant planets in our solar system have rings of their own. Uranus has 13 distinct rings made up of very dark particles, quite different from Saturn's rings, which are mostly water ice. Scientists believe that Uranus's rings formed after the planet took shape, from the leftovers of destroyed moons. The rings are tilted about 90 degrees and match Uranus's rotation."

Neptune's equator seems to rotate once every 18 hours while its polar regions spin once every 12 hours. This difference in rotational speed between the different regions is the largest of any planet and causes the strongest winds in the solar system, as fast as 2100 km/h!\n\nNeptune takes 165 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun."

Because they are smaller, dwarf planets lack the gravitational forces needed to pull in and accumulate all of the material found in their orbits. Each known dwarf planet in our solar system is actually smaller than Earth's Moon! "

Pluto was officially reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nThe best-known dwarf planet, Pluto is also the largest in size and the second largest in mass. Pluto has five moons. The largest, Charon, is over half the size of its host. Pluto's orbit is not circular like those of the other planets and it actually crosses Neptune's orbit, which means that Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune is. It takes Pluto nearly 250 years to complete one trip around the Sun.\n\nNot much was known about Pluto before NASA's New Horizons mission. Launched in 2006, the spacecraft took nearly nine years to reach its target. The mission revealed that Pluto's surface features plains and mountains made of nitrogen ice and water ice."

The discovery of this denser dwarf planet in 2005 may have been the turning point that forced astronomers to reconsider Pluto's classification as a planet. To illustrate this disruption, Eris was named after the Greek goddess of discord. Since Eris is so far away, no surface details can be seen with current instruments, but astronomers have detected the presence of methane ice and believe Eris's surface is similar to that of Pluto. "

It takes Ceres 4.6 years to complete one trip around the Sun. Scientists suspect that this unique dwarf planet may even have an ocean of liquid water hidden under a layer of ice.\n\nNASA's Dawn spacecraft was launched in 2007 and entered into orbit around Ceres after first observing nearby asteroid Vesta. Dawn allowed astronomers to see detailed images of the dwarf planet for the first time and find out more about its composition and surface."

Astronomers say that Makemake is likely reddish in colour, similar to Pluto. In 2015, a moon nicknamed MK2 was discovered orbiting the dwarf planet. Makemake takes over 300 years to complete a trip around the Sun."

Some of these celestial objects are large enough to be considered dwarf planets. Smaller bodies, often irregular in shape, are called comets and asteroids."

        " difference between an asteroid and a comet",
        "Although comets and asteroids can be similar in size, they are made of very different materials and are found in distinct parts of the solar system.\n\nComets are like dirty cosmic snowballs; they are made up of ice, frozen gases, rock and dust, and generally range from a few hundred metres in diameter to tens of kilometres wide. Comets are most often found in the outer solar system, far away from the Sun, where they remain frozen and difficult to observe. However, their elliptical orbits occasionally bring them close to the Sun, causing their ice and frozen gases to vaporize and form tails behind them. This effect makes comets much easier to spot from Earth.\n\nAsteroids, a type of minor planet, contain a lot of the same elements as the solar system's rocky planets, including carbon and metals. Their sizes can vary – many are less than 10 metres wide, but the largest asteroid ever detected, Vesta, is 530 kilometres wide. Most are found in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Although the belt contains millions of asteroids, its total mass is thought to be much less than that of Earth's Moon.\n\nWhile many comets are quite different from asteroids, scientists are finding more objects in the solar system that have some traits of both. For example, Manx comets have comet-like orbits, but they do not have tails and are composed of rocky material like asteroids."
