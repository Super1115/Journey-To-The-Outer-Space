    "tell me more about Jupiter",
    "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and also the largest in our solar system. Like all the other planets, it was likely formed in a massive, ancient cloud of gas, dust, and ice that collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc.\n\nScientists believe that many rocky planets larger than Earth existed in the early inner solar system. Physical forces moved Jupiter closer to the Sun and destroyed these other planets, allowing the formation of the current rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) before pushing Jupiter back outwards to its current position.\n\nJupiter has at least 79 known moons, which were drawn by the massive planet's strong gravitational pull. Fifty-three of them have names, while 26 are not yet named."

The solar system began as a large cloud of gas, dust, and ice, which collapsed into a spinning disc. The Sun was formed at its centre and particles began sticking together along rings in the disc â€“ leading to the formation of the planets."
