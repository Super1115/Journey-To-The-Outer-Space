Cloud layers and swirling storms can be seen clearly in its atmosphere, even with amateur telescopes. One storm, known as the Great Red Spot, has been observed by astronomers for centuries.

It is one of the best candidates for finding extraterrestrial life in our solar system.\n    Ganymede is huge – it's even larger than the planet Mercury – and is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field.\n    Callisto has the oldest and most heavily cratered surface in the solar system, which acts as a great time capsule for the history of the solar system.\n\nGalileo's observation that these moons orbit Jupiter provided evidence against the previously held belief that all bodies in the solar system orbit Earth.

It is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.\r\n\r\nThe days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period, orbital period, and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.\r\n\r\nThe smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.\r\n\r\nMars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars in 1965. The Viking landers in 1976 were the first to successfully land on the surface of Mars and send back images. More recently, the Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997 and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity in 2004 have provided a wealth of information about the Martian surface.\r\n\r\nMars is a potential destination for human exploration.
